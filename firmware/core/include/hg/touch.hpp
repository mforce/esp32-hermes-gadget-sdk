// Touchscreen gestures mapped onto the gadget's buttons, for boards whose
// screen is the main input:
//
//   hold the title          local settings after one second
//   hold the profile chip   the next Hermes profile after one second
//   hold elsewhere          TALK, held for as long as the finger stays down
//   quick tap               a TALK press and release (answers "yes" to a question)
//   swipe down              a CANCEL press and release (discard, close, stop, "no")
//
// Feed it raw touch samples; it calls App::on_button. Portable and clock-free,
// so the simulator and the tests drive it exactly like the firmware does.
