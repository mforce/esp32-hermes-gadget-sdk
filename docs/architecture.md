## Design goals

1. **Hermes stays unchanged.** The SDK plugs in through the gateway's platform-plugin interface and the hooks every adapter already has; see [hermes-integration.md](hermes-integration.md).
2. **The device stays thin.**
   - Speech recognition, text-to-speech, the language model, Markdown handling and image decoding all happen on the host.
   - The device captures audio, renders text and pixels, plays PCM and runs the actions it declares.
   - Firmware therefore needs no codecs, fonts beyond ASCII, or model-specific logic, and server-side improvements reach every board without reflashing.
3. **One core, many hosts.**
   - Everything that is not a driver lives in `firmware/core`: protocol, authentication, connection lifecycle, pairing UX, push-to-talk, VAD, playback control, UI, actions, telemetry and console. It is portable C++17 with no exceptions or RTTI, compiled unchanged for the ESP32 and for the desktop simulator.
   - The Hermes side mirrors this: `plugin/hub.py` knows nothing about Hermes and runs unchanged under the gateway adapter and under the standalone development server.
4. **Small surface, explicit contracts.**
   - The device–host protocol is one WebSocket carrying JSON control frames and binary media frames ([protocol.md](protocol.md)).
   - The device–driver contract is six small C++ interfaces (`firmware/core/include/hg/hal.hpp`).

## Device core (`firmware/core`)

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `hal.hpp` | `Display`, `AudioIn`, `AudioOut`, `Transport`, `Storage`, `System`, and the optional `Updater` (the firmware update slot): implemented per port |
| `app.hpp/.cpp` | `hg::App`, the single-threaded application. Connection phases (boot → network → connecting → handshake → online) × interaction modes (idle, listening, thinking, responding) × overlays (card, image, question). It also authorizes and checks firmware updates and confirms a new firmware once it reaches Hermes |
| `protocol.*`, `json.*`, `crypto.*` | Message helpers, a small JSON parser/serializer, SHA-256/HMAC/Base64 for authentication and update checks |
| `ui.*`, `canvas.*`, `font5x7.cpp` | Deterministic renderer: a `UiModel` is drawn in four horizontal bands (top bar, header, content, hint bar). Only bands whose inputs changed are redrawn and flushed |
| `vad.*` | Energy VAD that ends hands-free (tap) utterances on silence |

### Threading model

`App` is not thread-safe, and that is deliberate.

- Ports call `App::tick()` every 5–20 ms and deliver every asynchronous event (Wi-Fi up, WebSocket frame, microphone chunk, button edge, console line) on that same thread.
- On the ESP32, driver tasks post to a FreeRTOS queue that the main task drains.
- In the simulator, the WebSocket thread posts to a Python queue that the UI thread drains.

As a result the core has no locks and every test is deterministic.

### Rendering

- The port owns a full RGB565 framebuffer, in PSRAM on the ESP32.
- `Ui::render()` hashes the inputs of each band and redraws only the bands that changed, flushing them as full-width rows (contiguous memory, so a panel driver can DMA them).
- Animations (spinner, level meter, speaking bars) live only in the 35-pixel header band, so a 10 fps animation pushes about 22 KB/s over SPI.
- The renderer reads no clocks and uses no randomness. Identical models produce identical pixels, and the simulator tests rely on that.

### The mascot

Every screen that isn't showing reply text uses a **hero layout**: the Hermes Agent mascot, as large as the screen allows, with a short caption. That covers idle, listening, thinking, speaking before the text arrives, boot, connecting, offline, setup errors, pairing, short cards and questions.

- **Captions:** a headline and one detail line. Pairing, setup, cards and questions may wrap to three or four lines; the renderer picks the largest mascot that still fits, and drops caption lines rather than shrink her below the smallest bitmap. A question adds its two answer buttons under the caption.
- **No scrolling needed:** a card too long for a caption gets the text layout. Long replies and long cards page by themselves (about a second per line), so a board with no scroll buttons can still read everything. UP/DOWN scrolls by hand and pauses the paging for 15 s.

- **Source:** the bitmaps are generated by `hermes-gadget face` from Hermes's own artwork (`assets/mascot`) as 1-bit frames: idle, blink and talk, at 64, 96, 144 and 192 px. They take about 27 KB of flash. With no arguments the command regenerates exactly this art; [faces.md](faces.md) covers making the face something else.
- **Effects:** drawn on top of the frames:
  - blinking every few seconds;
  - green sound waves from her headphone cup while listening, scaled by the microphone level;
  - blue thought dots while thinking;
  - a moving mouth and amber waves while speaking.
- **Partial redraws:** the hero band tracks static content (screen, caption) separately from animation state. When only the animation changes, it redraws and flushes just the rows that animation can touch: the eye rows for a blink, the wave rows while listening. A blink therefore costs about 25 rows of SPI traffic, not a full screen.
- **Reply text:** a finished reply stays on screen for 20 s before the mascot returns. On boards with scroll buttons, UP brings it back.

### Interaction

- **Push-to-talk (default):** hold to speak, release to send. A press under 350 ms is discarded as a tap, and recording stops at 30 s.
- **Tap mode** (`set talk_mode tap`): tap to start; the VAD (or a second tap) ends the utterance.
- **Barge-in:** pressing talk while a reply plays stops playback immediately. The new message reaches Hermes, whose default "interrupt" busy mode stops the old turn.
- **Cancel** acts on release: it discards a recording, dismisses an overlay, or stops a turn (Hermes `/stop`).
- **Holding CANCEL for 2 s** starts a new session (`session.new` → Hermes `/new`). It fires while still held, after a countdown in the hint bar. The hold is the confirmation, so the plugin answers Hermes's "Confirm /new" itself.
- **Questions** from Hermes (other confirmations, dangerous-command approvals) take over the screen: TALK answers yes, CANCEL answers no. A question that arrives while you are recording waits until you finish.

## Hermes side (`plugin/`)

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `hub.py` | `DeviceHub` (websockets server, handshake and enrollment, heartbeats, routing) and `DeviceSession` (outbound API: replies, status, cards, images, paced `AudioOut`, `invoke_action`) |
| `adapter.py` | `GadgetAdapter`, the `HubDelegate` that maps device traffic to `MessageEvent`s and Hermes output to device frames |
| `tools.py` | Agent tools, run on agent worker threads and bridged to the hub loop with `run_coroutine_threadsafe` |
| `textfmt.py` | Markdown → plain text, typography → ASCII |
| `audio.py` | WAV packing, streaming resampler, file decoding (WAV natively, the rest through ffmpeg) |
| `imaging.py` | Any image → RGB565 that fits the device's image box (Pillow) |
| `store.py` | Device keys and pending pairing codes in the plugin's data directory |

### Audio pacing

`AudioOut` resamples whatever Hermes produces (24 kHz streaming PCM, MP3/OGG/WAV files) to the device's declared rate. It sends 40 ms frames at most 0.5 s ahead of real time. If the producer stalls (a streaming TTS provider between sentences), the pacing clock rebases, so it never bursts more than the lead. A device therefore needs about 1 s of buffer whatever the reply length.

### Security model

- **Network gate (optional):** `GADGET_ACCESS_TOKEN`, a shared secret every device presents in `hello`.
- **Device identity:**
  - Each device holds a random 32-byte key, and its id is a hash of that key.
  - The key is sent once, at enrollment. After that the device proves possession with an HMAC over a fresh server nonce, so recorded traffic cannot be replayed.
  - Another device cannot take over an enrolled id.
- **Authorization:** Hermes's own allowlists and DM pairing. Every message from a device is authorized by the gateway runner exactly like a message from a Telegram user, and pairing approval happens on the Hermes host. Device-selected profiles: authorization in the default profile admits a device to every profile the gateway serves, and the plugin records that grant in each profile's pairing store when the device first switches; revocation in the default profile returns the device to it.
- **Transport:** use `wss://` (`tls_cert`/`tls_key`) on any network you don't trust. On a home LAN, plain `ws://` exposes conversation content to anyone on the network, though not the device key after enrollment.

## Why not use an existing Hermes API instead of a plugin?

Hermes also exposes an OpenAI-compatible API server and a JSON-RPC backend for its TUI and desktop app. A thin device could post text to either one. A platform adapter is the better fit:

- **Voice:** voice messages get Hermes's STT and auto-TTS for free, including streaming PCM. The HTTP API has no audio input, and the device would need its own ASR.
- **Identity and authorization:** each device becomes a first-class chat with its own session, memory and pairing, rather than an API client sharing one key.
- **Push:** the gateway can push to the device (cron results, `send_message`, other chats driving its tools) over the open socket.
- **Reach:** the adapter gets streaming previews, status phrases, interrupts and approvals through the same paths every messaging platform uses.
